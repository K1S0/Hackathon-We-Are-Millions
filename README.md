# Hackathon-We-Are-Millions
<i>Memes are mirroring the issues of the time, being a medium that is easily understood and easily distributed. This challenge is a competition to create a meme that reflects on one or more of the topics covered at the WAM event and can be used to spread awareness about them.</i>

Your privacy is at risk on the Internet. The main problem with the Internet is that not everything that happens on the Internet is directly and physically harmful to the people it affects. When sites or hackers collect your personal data (photos, visited sites, communications...), you don't see it, feel it or hear it. You may notice it at the end of the day, when the damage is done (identity theft with false declarations, refusal of a job because of questionable comments or photos...). Apart from this type of event, the phenomenon remains entirely imperceptible.This is the difficulty: to be aware that even if you don't feel it, the danger exists and you must protect yourself by using adequate tools.
